# Multimodal Hate Meme Detection

The pervasive issue of hate speech in online communication, particularly focusing on hate memes, is a challenging yet crucial aspect. Hate speech has become prevalent in virtual spaces due to its anonymity, reducing accountability among individuals. In contemporary
social media landscapes, memes have emerged as a prominent medium for expressing ideas and blending images and text in unique ways. While memes are often associated with humor or implicit messaging, they can also convey irony or hatred, making them potentially harmful.

Detecting hate speech in memes poses a significant challenge compared to traditional text-based methods. For instance, combining seemingly innocuous images and text can create ironic or offensive meanings. This complexity demands advanced techniques that can analyze both visual and textual elements.

We experimented with a few techniques like VisualBert, RoBERTa, and ViLBert, for multimodal hate meme detection. These methods leverage cutting-edge technologies to integrate visual and textual information, enabling more accurate and comprehensive identification of hate speech within memes. The research underscores the critical need to address hate speech in its multimodal forms, highlighting the importance of advanced computational approaches to safeguard online spaces from harmful content.
